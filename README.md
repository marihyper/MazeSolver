This is a simple maze solver, making use of recursive methods, written in Java, that can help you solve similar kind of puzzles, given certain restrictions.

## TEST and USE Instructions:
1) Creat a new project in your prefered IDE;
2) Import all the files in the src folder in this repository into the src folder in your IDE;
3) Run MainMaze Java class;
4) The program will ask for keyboard input, type maze1 or maze2 or maze3 and press enter;
5) The program will provide the solution for the maze1, maze2 or maze3 files respectively, which are imported in the src folder.

## How to make my own maze:
1) Creat a new document in Notepad;
2) In the first line, inform the number of lines of your maze, type enter;
3) In the second line, inform the number of rows of your maze, type enter;
4) Write your own maze (use the example files in src folder as a guide);
5) Save your file and carefully name it, since you have to type it later;
6) On File Explorer, remove the extension .txt from your file;
7) Import your file into the src folder.
8) Repeat step 3 of **TEST and USE Instructions**, replacing the example file names with your new file name.
### Note:
1) Don't forget to fill all spaces of your maze. Use SPACE to fill in your path. If the maze has missing characters, in any line or row, the program will crash.
2) Your IDE might have remove trailing spaces option on by default. Make sure to turn off that option, since it will mess with the maze files spacing.
